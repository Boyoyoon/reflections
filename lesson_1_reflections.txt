How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It told me exactly which line to look at for the changed text
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Well I'd be able to get an idea of where I was trying to head if I ever get lost
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
I like manually commiting to a save for coding because it insures that the history will follow a logical progression provided the user is logical about them
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Well it's apparent that coders need to be able to see which files where changed because they're intricately related, unlike documents being written in docs
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
log will display a list of commits, diff will then tell you specific differences between commits
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Oh my gosh because I can do anything I want to the code and find out exactly where I fucked up. Yay version control!

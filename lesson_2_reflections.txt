What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You create a new repository with no commits, necessary for tracking changes
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is where you tell git what files in the repository are going to be committed. I'm not sure why it can't find that out itself, but meh

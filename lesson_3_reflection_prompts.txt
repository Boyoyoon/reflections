When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When collaborating with other people or when working on the project from multiple computers
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Still dunno
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Clones copy all commits into another repository, fork clones on github, and branches are seperate commit trees
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can check it to the current most recent commit
